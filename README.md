# TaCZ BR

Made By [AiJYGR](https://space.bilibili.com/1788766018/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is a modpack that allows you to ***play BR game in minecraft***. It's based on TaCZ, and I made it a simple map, a simple resoucepack and a datapack.
There is a **basic BR system**.

That includes Looting, Backpack, Launching, and so on.

Plz enjoy!


If you have any suggestions or you meet any bugs, please let me know.

Better DM me on Bilibili cause I can rarely use github.
