How to write a README QwQ

I'm dumb...Never Mind.

# TaCZ BR

This is a modpack that allows you to ***play BR game in minecraft***. It's based on TaCZ, and I made it a simple map, a simple resoucepack and a datapack.
There is a **basic BR system**.

That includes Looting, Backpack, Launching, and so on.

Please enjoy!


If you have any suggestions or you meet any bugs, please let me know.

Better DM me on Bilibili cause I can rarely use github.
